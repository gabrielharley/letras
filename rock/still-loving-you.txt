Time, it needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love, only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there
I will be there

Fight, babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love, only love
Can break down the wall someday
I will be there
I will be there

If we'd go again all the way from the start
I would try to change the things that killed our love
Pride has built a wall so strong that I can't get through
Is there really no chance to start once again?
I'm loving you

Try, baby, try
To trust in my love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love, our love
Just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there
I will be there

If we'd go again all the way from the start
I would try to change the things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride and I know what you've been through
You should give me a chance
This can't be the end

I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
